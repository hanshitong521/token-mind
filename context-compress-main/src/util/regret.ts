/**
 * ACON-style self-improving compression policy.
 *
 * ACON (Kang et al., 2026) optimizes a compression *guideline* in natural-language
 * space by analyzing cases where the full context succeeds but the compressed
 * context fails, then refines the guideline — no model fine-tuning. We can't run
 * paired trajectories at runtime, but we can approximate the failure signal from
 * the agent's own behavior: if a command is compressed aggressively and then
 * *re-run almost immediately*, the aggressive summary probably hid something the
 * agent needed. That's a "compression regret".
 *
 * The policy this drives is deliberately narrow and safe:
 *   - We only count a regret for a FAST re-run (default ≤ 30s) that followed an
 *     AGGRESSIVE compression. Balanced/conservative are never blamed — they
 *     rarely drop task-critical data, and normal edit→rerun loops (which are
 *     slower and usually ran under balanced) shouldn't be misread as regret.
 *   - The only adjustment is a one-step DOWNGRADE (aggressive → balanced) once a
 *     fingerprint's regret rate is high over enough samples. Downgrading only
 *     ever *reduces* compression, so a false positive costs a few tokens, never
 *     correctness. It never makes anything more aggressive on its own.
 *
 * State is a small JSON map at ~/.context-compress/regret.json, keyed by the same
 * command fingerprint the auto-mode cache uses, so it persists across sessions.
